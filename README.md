# mpdscripts

A collection of (mostly old and overly complex) convenience scripts to control MPD with MPC. Still used daily, though.

# Usage

	ply love hate

Clears playlist, loads all tracks matching "love" and "hate" into playlist, starts playback.
	
	jmp love hate

Plays the only track matching "love" and "hate" in current playlist. If not hits: Retrieve from library. If more than one hit: Ask the user to choose a single track.

	jmp 40

Jumps to 40% of the current playback

	jmp emotions chriz && jmp 24

Inside Joke for friends of good house music ;)
